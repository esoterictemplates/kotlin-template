# Ideas

This file is used to track ideas and planned features for this project. Implemented ideas will be moved to [FEATURES.md](./docs/FEATURES.md).

## Will Implement

## Considered

- Add GitLab CI/CD configuration?
- Add Jitpack configuration ([jitpack.yml file](./jitpack.yml))!
- Create a GitHub workflow that builds and publishes a release when a new tag is pushed.
- Add a publishing configuration. And in general update [build.gradle.kts](./app/build.gradle.kts).
- Use [libs.versions.toml](./gradle/libs.versions.toml) for all dependencies and plugins.
- Configure a display name in [settings.gradle.kts](./settings.gradle.kts)?
- Update run configuration to not depend on a user having a JRE in a specific folder (remember to configure JBR).
