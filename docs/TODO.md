# Ideas

This file is used to track ideas and planned features for this project. Implemented ideas will be moved to [FEATURES.md][features].

## To-Do

### Additions

- [CONTRIBUTING.md][contributing].
- [SUPPORT.md][support].

### Changes

### Removals

## Considered

### Additions

- Pull request template?
- Markdown linter GitLab CI/CD?
- [UPGRADING.md][upgrading] file?
- Code owner information?
- [FAQ.md file][faq]?
- [CONTRIBUTORS.md][contributors]?
- [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml][issue-configuration]? (more information: [here][issue-configuration-link])
- Add custom donation link?
- Add an [editorconfig file](./.editorconfig)?
- Add list of example usages of this template.
- Not technically an idea for this repository, but I should create the following templates:
  - Minecraft resource pack template.
  - Minecraft datapack template.
  - Minecraft mod template.
  - Godot project template.
  - Unity project template.

### Changes

- Move this repository to GitLab and set up a push mirror?
- For each documentation file, make one that is relevant to the template and one relevant to a project that would be generated from the template. This is in order to separate the template project from generated projects, would improve organisation and clarity.
- Update [badge][badges] SVG data and conventions.

### Removals

## Won't Implement

### Additions

### Changes

- Update copyright and credit to use "Esoteric Templates". - Esoteric Templates isn't really an *entity* that can hold copyright per se, and instead just a collection of templates. My name will be used for copyright.

### Removals

- Remove year from copyright notice as I would have to maintain this? - this is best practice.
